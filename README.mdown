# AS/400 Shell

A simple shell for interacting with the AS/400 via jt400.  After spending a lot of time writing custom
code to interrogate an AS/400, it became increasingly simpler to build my own tooling for working with
the AS/400.

As a result, this shell was born. I don't know that it will be useful for anyone else, but I may never
need it again myself, and it seemed wise to share it as widely as I could.
